# diff-sampler
diff-sampler is an open-source toolbox for fast sampling of diffusion models, to provide a fair comparison of existing approaches and help researchers to develp better approaches. diff-sampler contains various model implementations, numerical-based solvers, time schedules, and other features.  

This repository also includes (or will include) the official implementations of our following works:

## News
- **2024-11-13**. The official implementation of the paper [Simple and Fast Distillation of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19681) is released in [sfd-main](./sfd-main/). We simplify and accelerate the distillation of Diffusion Models. The proposed method accelerates the fine-tuning up to 1000 times while preserving high-quality few-step image generation.

- **2024-10-01**. Our new work [Simple and Fast Distillation of Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19681) is accepted by NeurIPS 2024! We will release the code as soon as possible.
- **2024-09-12**. We release diff-analyzer as an easy toolbox for analyzing the behavior of the sampling of diffusion models. We offer the code for reproducing some observations in our works [A Geometric Perspective on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19947) and [On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326). <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="./gits-main/assets/traj_3d.png" alt="traj_regularity" width="800px"></div>
- **2024-06-20**. GITS is integrated into [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) as [GITSScheduler](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/blob/master/comfy_extras/nodes_gits.py)! We provide a [ComfyUI workflow](./assets/workflow-gits.json) to compare GITS with the baseline time schedule and the concurrent ICML 2024 paper [Align Your Steps: Optimizing Sampling Schedules in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14507). More details are included in our pull request [here](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI/pull/3769). <div style="text-align: center;"><img src="assets/workflow-gits.png" alt="workflow-gits" width="800px"></div>
- **2024-06-18**. The official implementation of the paper [On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326) is released in [gits-main](./gits-main/). 
  - This new repo is built on the basis of [diff-solvers-main](./diff-solvers-main/), supporting baseline sampling as well as customized time schedule. Our method (GITS) offers a more efficient time schedule for fast sampling of diffusion models.
  - For text-to-image generation, we provide a [colab script](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dxyVyI9SBozYcfS5bUNxKCjaTxPrdWSr?usp=sharing) using Diffusers ðŸ§¨ where we also compare our methods with the concurrent work [Align Your Steps](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/toronto-ai/AlignYourSteps/). Below is a 10-step comparison.

- **2024-06-03**. The repo is made easier to use. Now the pre-trained models will be automatically downloaded to `./src/dataset_name`. Some errors and typos are fixed. Detailed running scripts are provided in `launch.sh`, where we also add new scripts for evaluation of CLIP score for Stable Diffusion.
- **2024-05-02**. Our work [On the Trajectory Regularity of ODE-based Diffusion Sampling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11326) is accepted by ICML 2024.
- **2024-04-05**. Our work [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00094) is selected as a **Highlight** paper (Top 2.8%) by CVPR 2024!
- **2024-03-25**. The official implementation of the paper [Fast ODE-based Sampling for Diffusion Models in Around 5 Steps](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00094) ([amed-solver-main](./amed-solver-main/)) and a toolbox ([diff-solvers-main](./diff-solvers-main/)) for fast sampling of diffusion models is released. We upload the reference statistics for FID evaluation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1f8qf5qtUewCdDrkExK_Tk5-qC-fNPKpL?usp=sharing). Hope that this repo can facilitate researchers on fast sampling of diffusion models!

## TODO
- [x] Give an example of AMED-Plugin on Stable Diffusion using [Diffusers](https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers) ðŸ§¨.
- [x] Integrate the GITS time schedule into [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) and provide a ComfyUI workflow.
- [x] Release the code of [A Geometric Perspective on Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19947) for easier analysis of Diffusion Models.
